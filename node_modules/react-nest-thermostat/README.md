This (unofficial) React component provides a basic display of the Nest thermostat.

### Live Demo
View the [live demo](https://run.plnkr.co/plunks/SYkIZmFFL8tCHnTHMGJY/)! Note that this demo uses pre-compiled code, so it's a little messy to examine.

### Installation
```
npm install react-nest-thermostat
```
